            Coding has been around for a long time, and with it the emergence of powerful code editors. All these editors have had unique features, major differences, and of course, lots of bugs. However, through innovation these tools have evolved over time into something else, and with the introduction of AI, code editors have become even better now. There are many to choose from in today’s day and age, each with a different suite of exciting features companies always advertise as the ‘best’. With all the competition, and code editors rapidly changing, it seems we are in the middle of a war, where each code editor promises to be the best, and better than the last. Let’s explore some of the major code editors in history, and be sure to highlight the road that led us here, one code editor at a time.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-500">TECO (1962) - The First Code Editor</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            One of the first widely recognized editors in the early days TECO was created by Dan Murphy at MIT in 1962. It was originally built for the PDP-1 computer (the first commercial microcomputer) and proved quit useful for writing and correcting code.
	Unlike modern editors we have today, TECO used a command line interface (modal editor) meaning users would have to type commands to navigate around the editor and edit text. It was kind of like a find and replace tool more than an editor. However, it did allow users to automate editing tasks. TECO automated editing tasks primarily through its built-in macro language and command interpreter. It allowed users to record sequences of commands as a single macro. You could string together navigation, insertion, deletion, and search commands. Once recorded, a macro could be replayed to perform repetitive tasks automatically, reducing the need for manual re-entry of common editing sequences. Users could also write a series of commands in a file or directly in the TECO command line.These command sequences could perform complex operations, like batch search-and-replace, formatting, or structural changes to the text. Furthermore, TECO’s command language included basic control structures like loops and conditional statements. This meant you could create loops to repeat a set of commands until a condition was met or conditionally execute parts of your macro, which was essential for handling variable text structures. To tie it all together TECO had something known as interactive execution. This meant that commands were executed as they were typed, but they could also be saved and reused. This dual mode of operation made TECO both interactive and programmable, offering immediate feedback while also enabling the automation of complex, multi-step editing tasks. 
	In summary, TECO’s automation capabilities stemmed from its macro system and simple programming constructs, allowing users to define, store, and execute repetitive editing routines. This pioneering approach laid the groundwork for many modern text editors and IDEs that continue to incorporate powerful automation features.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-500">Vim - The Timeless Text Editor</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Vim (Vi IMproved) is a highly efficient, modal text editor that has been a favorite among programmers and system administrators since its release in 1991. It is an extended and improved version of Vi, which was originally developed for Unix in 1976. Vim is known for its keyboard-driven editing, extensibility, and speed, making it an essential tool for many developers even today. 
	Vim uses a unique modal editing system, meaning it has different modes for different tasks. Each mode is designed to do one specific thing, and be efficient at what it does. Normal mode is used for navigation and editing (e.g., deleting, copying, and pasting text). Insert mode is used for typing text (similar to traditional text editors). Visual mode is used for selecting and manipulating text. Command mode is used for running commands like saving, quitting, and searching. This modal approach allows Vim to be highly efficient because you don’t need to move your hands off the keyboard to switch between editing and navigation. It can make programmer more productive without even having to touch a mouse when in their editor.
	However, with all these extensive features, the learning curve is steep for sure. Coming from conventional editors, switching to Vim’s modal editing (normal, insert, visual, and command modes) can feel completely alien. It often takes a few days to get used to the idea of not having a mouse and relying solely on keyboard commands. In addition, Vim has a vast array of commands—each with its own key combinations. Beginners may feel overwhelmed by the need to remember shortcuts for navigation, editing, searching, and more. It’s not uncommon to spend weeks or even months just getting comfortable with the basic commands. Even after mastering the basics, many of Vim’s powerful features—like macros, custom scripting in Vimscript, and advanced text manipulation—take much longer to learn and integrate into your workflow. It’s a process of continuous learning. However, while the learning curve is steep, many users find that the efficiency gains are well worth the initial struggle. Once you're proficient, you can navigate and edit text incredibly quickly, often more efficiently than in any mouse-driven editor.
	Another part of Vim that makes it so special is its wide range of plugins. These plugins enhance functionality, introduce new features, and streamline the editing experience. Often, finding the right plugin isn’t hard as the Vim community has already made so many plugins, that there for sure is something for everyone. For instance NERDTree is a file system explorer that allows users to navigate and manage files directly within Vim. It provides a tree-like directory view, making it easier to visualize and access project files. Moreover, vim-fugitive is a Git wrapper that brings Git commands into Vim. Users can execute Git operations, view commit histories, and manage branches without leaving the editor. These are only two amazing examples of great plugins in Vim provided by the community, there are so many more that are helpful to devs out there. The point is, Vim is a highly customizable editor with all these resources available to you, and makes your editor more personalized to fit you specific development needs. If anything, that is a powerful asset to have, a good customizable setup can really make a developer do great things, and Vim gives you that and so much more.
	Vim is an incredibly powerful, efficient, and customizable text editor that has stood the test of time. While it takes effort to learn, mastering Vim can greatly improve productivity, and really make you level up as a developer.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-500">Eclipse - Simple yet Efficient</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Released in 2001, Eclipse was mainly an editor used for the Java programming language, but later adapted a rich plugin system to incorporate other languages as well, like C, C++, Python, Javascript and many more. It was mainly used to develop enterprise apps, and had been the most popular code editor for Java until 2016 when Intellej surpassed it.
            Eclipse was initially developed by IBM in the early 2000s as part of their effort to create an open-source, extensible integrated development environment (IDE). Since it was meant to be a platform for developing Java applications, Eclipse was primarily written in Java, making it a Java-based IDE. This was intentional, as Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy aligns well with the goal of creating an IDE that could be used across multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux). The Eclipse platform itself, which includes the core of the IDE, is built on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP). RCP is essentially a set of libraries that allow developers to build their own applications with a rich graphical user interface (GUI), based on the same foundation Eclipse uses. The RCP was designed to be highly extensible, making it possible to develop plugins to enhance or modify Eclipse’s features.
            Eclipse's plugin architecture is a cornerstone of its flexibility and extensibility. At its core, Eclipse is built upon the OSGi framework, which treats each plugin as a self-contained bundle. Each bundle includes a manifest file that outlines critical metadata—such as the plugin’s name, version, and dependencies—and informs the OSGi runtime of the services it provides and requires. This modular approach enables Eclipse to manage plugins dynamically, allowing for on-demand loading, updating, or removal without needing to restart the entire IDE. A pivotal element of this system is the concept of extension points. Eclipse defines specific extension points that act as hooks for integrating additional functionality. Plugins contribute to these extension points through declarations in their plugin.xml files, enabling them to introduce new editors, views, or even language-specific tools. During startup, Eclipse scans for these declarations, building a dynamic extension registry that maintains a loose coupling between the core IDE and its plugins. This design means that a plugin offering new functionality can be seamlessly integrated without requiring the core system to be aware of every potential extension in advance.
            Complementing this robust architecture is the Plugin Development Environment (PDE), which equips developers with tools to create, test, and debug their plugins. The PDE provides wizards and debugging tools that facilitate the development process, including the ability to launch a separate runtime workbench. This sandboxed environment allows developers to experiment with their plugins without risking disruptions to their primary workspace. Furthermore, the OSGi framework handles the complete lifecycle of plugins—managing their activation, deactivation, and updating—ensuring that Eclipse remains a stable and reliable environment even as its functionality is extended.
            Overall, eclipse was a powerful editor, and had a rich set of features to offer, in the 2000’s it was definitely the king of Java development and later expanded to include many other languages as well. However, as of today, eclipse hold little relevance, as other more dominant editors have come along to take its place.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-500">IntelliJ - The Smart One</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            IntelliJ is more than just a code editor; it's a comprehensive suite of development tools. Its intelligence shines through with features like smart code completion and AI integration, which accelerate development. Built-in database features and seamless Git integration further streamline the workflow. IntelliJ provides a rich set of capabilities that empower developers to build efficiently.
            This editor was developed by JetBrains and is designed to be a modern, state of the art code editor which is primarily designed for Java development, but has support for many other languages and frameworks as well. Similar to Eclipse, Intellij has its own unique plugin system which supports JetBrains-specific plugins and 3rd party plugins as well. These plugins can range from simple convenience tools, to full fledged support for many different frameworks out there, meant to make developing in a framework easier than before. All the plugins are found in the JetBrains marketplace, which itself lives inside the editor, once again being convenient.
            However, a major thing that sets this editor apart from the rest is that there is little configuration needed and sets everything up out-of-the-box. From the moment you install the editor, it comes preloaded with a rich set of features that are intelligently configured to suit most project setups. For instance, features such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and refactoring tools are ready to use immediately, without requiring extensive manual tweaking. The editor automatically detects project structures, manages dependencies, and even configures build tools like Maven or Gradle based on your project files. This zero-configuration approach extends to integrated tools like version control systems, databases, and testing frameworks, which are seamlessly incorporated into the user interface. As a result, developers can focus more on writing code and less on spending time on initial setup or environment configuration. This out-of-the-box readiness is a significant part of Intellij’s appeal, especially for those transitioning from more cumbersome editors that require a lot of manual setup.
            IntelliJ IDEA also shines in UI and usability, offering a polished, modern interface that is considered more user-friendly compared to Eclipse’s sometimes cluttered experience. Features like Git integration, database tools, and built-in terminal support are seamlessly incorporated into the interface without requiring additional configuration. The Live Templates feature helps speed up coding by allowing developers to create reusable code snippets, while the Refactoring Engine provides intelligent suggestions for restructuring code safely. 
            It is a great editor that does most of the heavy lifting for you and is one of the most modern editors to date, aiming to stay in this competitive market in the future.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-500">Visual Studio Code - Efficiency Is Key</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Visual Studio Code is a name that has been widely recognized in the industry and is one of the favorites that is used for web development. It has a ton of features to make development feel more productive, and has a wide range of extensions that allow you to add on functionality on top of the base features. 
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) was first announced by Microsoft on April 29, 2015, during the Build 2015 developer conference. Initially released as a preview version, it was designed to be a lightweight yet powerful code editor with built-in Git integration, debugging tools, and support for multiple programming languages. Unlike the full-fledged Visual Studio IDE, VS Code was built to be a fast, cross-platform editor available on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Later that year, on November 18, 2015, Microsoft open-sourced VS Code under the MIT License, making its source code publicly available on GitHub. The first stable version, 1.0, was officially released on April 14, 2016.
VS Code is built using Electron, a framework that allows web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create cross-platform desktop applications. Under the hood, it uses Node.js for backend processing and Chromium to render the UI, giving it a web-based feel while running as a native desktop app. The core editor functionality is powered by Monaco Editor, the same code editor used in Microsoft’s Azure and other web-based development tools.
It has many core languages for web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript) built into the editor, which makes developing web applications very convenient. The application itself is very lightweight and efficient, having lower startup times than other editors, and being faster at executing certain tasks. It can however, be fully customized to support many languages and frameworks through extensions that can be downloaded from the extensions tab built inside of VS Code. This has earned it the reputation of being an all-around editor good at everything while having efficiency as well.
Additionally, version control with Git is built into VS Code and can be used by interacting with a terminal in the editor, as well as having a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for convenience. This interface allows you to perform essential Git operations like staging changes, committing, pushing, pulling, and viewing diffs directly within the editor. The Source Control panel offers an intuitive view of your repository’s status, letting you easily manage branches and resolve merge conflicts without leaving VS Code. Additionally, the extensibility of VS Code means you can further enhance Git functionality with a range of extensions tailored to your workflow.
GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant developed in collaboration with OpenAI, made its debut in Visual Studio Code in June 2021 as part of its technical preview. This innovative extension quickly integrated into the VS Code ecosystem, providing real-time code suggestions and completions that transformed the way developers approached coding. With Copilot, developers could leverage its advanced machine learning model to generate code snippets, automate repetitive tasks, and even receive context-aware recommendations—all directly within their familiar coding environment. The early integration of GitHub Copilot in VS Code marked a significant milestone, setting the stage for broader adoption and continuous refinement of AI-assisted development workflows.
With all of these cutting-edge features, VS Code has a lot of use cases for all types of people working in software including software engineers, data scientists, people who work in cybersecurity and many more. This is why it is one of the most used code editors today and will still be used many years from now.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-500">Cursor - Next-Level AI</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Initially released in 2023 by Anysphere Inc, Cursor was the first AI Code editor to have A different type of AI integration. It came packaged with the editor and could offer multi file completes, and had a full built-on chat interface to communicate effectively to the AI for all your development needs. It was not only different, but pushed the boundaries AI Integration could achieve. By having an complete AI development package from the start many found cursor to be appealing, and even some VS Code users made the switch rather quickly.
            One of the stand out features of Cursor’s AI is that it can understand your entire codebase. This meant giving it instructions was easier, as it already knew what code you were referencing, and didn’t need extra clarification. Also, devs could just as easily chat with the codebase itself and the AI could provide helpful insights on what could be improved or just share general knowledge. This functionality could be utilized in many ways. For instance, a developer jumping in on another team’s project would not need explanations from the other developers about the code base. Instead, they could simply ask the AI in Cursor to explain parts of the codebase to them, which not only makes things efficient, but makes collaboration on large projects so much easier. Cursor’s AI leverages many different models including Claude 3.5, Deepseek, and many versions of OpenAI’s GPT model. 
            Another feature which makes Cursor different than most AI coding assistant is the AI Agent built into it. The agent acts as a sort of other developer working alongside of you, and has the ability to create and edit multiple files all at once, when given instructions. This can speed up developer productivity and save much time instead of writing code yourself. In Cursor it is called ‘Composer’, and as of now it is a coding partner that programs with you, and is not only efficient, but accurate.
            In addition to these features, Cursor also provides code completion, just like many of the AI out there already and does it seamlessly. This in turn, speeds up productivity even more, and can make small repetitive tasks a breeze for developers to accomplish.
            Cursor was actually just built on top of the open source editor VS Code and is very accessible from someone coming from VS Code. It is as simple as just connecting the same account you use for VS Code to Cursor, and Cursor gets configured with all your user settings from VS Code, including extensions. This onboarding process can make the switch for VS Code users very easy and tempting.
                Cursor has been one of the most revolutionary editors the world as seen. With amazing AI features, Cursor is the future of coding and development. I am sure in the near future other fully AI code editors will see the light of day, and the industry will be transformed forever. For now, Cursor is definitely the best in the AI Department, but that could all change very soon.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-500">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p></p>
        Code editors come and go, and I’m confident we are not even at the cutting edge yet, and still have many long years to go before that ever happens, but the innovation is only growing. Speed, efficiency, power, we all have seen these attributes in modern day editors, and the level of these traits will only start to go higher. I am frankly excited about the future of code editors, and software development itself. New roads will be carved, different paths taken, but they will all lead to a more innovative future ahead.
